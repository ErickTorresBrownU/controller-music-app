This is a Tauri application. The backend is written in Rust and the frontend in TypeScript React.

Game controller compatability will be handled in Rust. Game controls will be processed and forwarded to the frontend by emitting events. You can read more about that here: <https://v1.tauri.app/v1/guides/features/events>
